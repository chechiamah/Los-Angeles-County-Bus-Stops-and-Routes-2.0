# Los Angeles County Bus Stops and Routes 2.0

A more extensive project mapping LA County bus routes and stops.

This project uses [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and data from the [LACMTA GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/LACMTA/gtfs_bus) to visualize transit systems across Los Angeles County.
